Use VSCode extensions for better development:

Prettier - Code Formatter: For auto-formatting code.
Debugging: Add breakpoints in App.js and use VSCode's debugger.
7. Edit and Customize
Open App.js in VSCode.
Modify components, styles, or functionality as needed. Changes will auto-refresh the browser.
